iMal invited me [to give a talk](http://imal.org/en/artssciences/jonasdegrave) of an hour on the topic of Artificial Intelligence and Art, for an audience which is made majorly out of artists and art enthousiasts. I took the challenge, and you may view the results underneath.

The reactions have been overwhelmingly positive, and I have had many productive discussions with artists afterwards. It is remarkable, how some people arrive to the same broad conclusions in minutes as data scientists in years of research.
