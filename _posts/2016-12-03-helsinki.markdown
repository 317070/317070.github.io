Artificial intelligence might replace taxi-drivers in the future, but how will the future of cultural journalists look like in light of future technological revolutions? 

The Finnish Cultural Institute for the Benelux invited me [to give a talk](http://www.finncult.be/critical-utopias-designmuseum-helsinki/?lang=en) in the design musem in Helsinki on the topic of a future of art and art critics, in an age of rapid evolution of technology.

Unfortunately, the video failed, so there is nothing to show on this blog.
